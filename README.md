# Discourse Category Header theme component
This theme component provides a number of enhancements and custom settings for the discourse category header.

The default core Discourse category header is displayed on the category page above the navigation links. It is ONLY visible if a category logo image is uploaded in the category settings. The settings also allow for upload a category background image, which is displayed as a background image over the whole page.
