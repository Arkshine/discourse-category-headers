# Discourse Category Header Theme Component

This theme component provides a number of enhancements and custom settings for the discourse category header.

The default Discourse category header is displayed above the navigation links. It is only visible if a Category logo is uploaded when editing the category settings. The logo displays on the left and the category description adjacent to it. It is also possible to upload a Category background image, which displays a background image over the whole page.

The Discourse Category Header Theme Component provides the following enhancements.

By default:

The category header now displays for all categories, irrespective of whether a logo has been uploaded. You can choose not to display a category header by entering it in the exceptions list by choosing not to display headers for categories without category descriptions. You can also choose whether to display the category headers for subcategories. By default they are displayed with some new enhancements mentioned below. 

The category name is now shown in the category header above the category description. You can now choose to align the text to the left, centre or right of the header. If the category is a subcategory, you can optionally display the parent category name in front of the subcategory name as follows = Parent category name: Subcategory Name. The parent category name is a breadcrumb link and clicking it will take you to the parent category page.

The category logo is sized to display to the left of the text in the header. You can optionally choose to display it on the right of the text, or at the top above the text. The logo can also be resized to a small logo, similar to a subcategory box, or displayed at it's original uploaded size.

You can set an alternative logo to display if you have not uploaded a category logo. If it is a subcategory you can default to show the parent category logo if the sub=category does not have one of it's own. If there is no logo, you can select to display your small site logo by default - or not to display and logo and just have the Category name and text description.

The category header is now styled to display in a box, similar in appearance to the standard Discourse subcategory boxes. These have the category color as a thicker line on the left border of the box. You can optionally choose to display the category headers with no borders.

The header background color and text color can be set to one of three choices. You can choose to display
* None â€“ so there are no background or text adjustments. These your site's theme background and text colors.
* A shaded background based on your theme primary color and secondary colors. This will automatically adjust with your site light and dark themes.
* The category background (badge) color as the background and the category foreground color as the text color - as selected for each category in the category settings. These are typically bolder colors and make the header appear like a banner, similar to the discourse category banners theme. These colors are fixed and display the as the same color on all themes.

The category background image can now be set to display as the background of the category header, instead of as the background of the whole page. You can have a number of options to contain and resize the image to fill the header. Alternatively you can keep it as the page background and style your banner background separately using the options above.
